Manta Airfoil Tools is a desktop app for creating and testing airfoil shapes (the curved shape that helps airplanes fly and hydrofoils generate lift).
In one place, you can pick or generate a profile, preview it in `2D/3D`, get a quick `lift/drag` estimate, rerun a more accurate `XFOIL` simulation on the fly, and export ready-to-use files for CAD or 3D printing.
You can start from standard `NACA` codes or from a built-in library with thousands of real airfoil profiles with geometry, aerodynamic data, performance ratings, and easy profile selection.
Validation ground truth is experimental data; quick estimates and `XFOIL` are compared against test datasets.

https://github.com/giuliodori/manta-airfoil-tools/releases/latest
```

Latest release includes two Windows builds:

- `Manta_Airfoil_Tools_portable_<version>.exe` (portable, no installer)
- `Manta_Airfoil_Tools_setup_<version>.exe` (installer)

## Why people use it

Most early airfoil work is not blocked by solver depth. It is blocked by workflow friction:

- finding the right profile
- generating clean geometry
- exporting in the format your downstream tool accepts
- getting a quick sanity check before moving on

Manta Airlab compresses that workflow into one local app with direct GUI editing and immediate geometry plus quick aerodynamic feedback (`lift`, `drag`, `Cl`, `Cd`, `Cm`, `L/D`).

## What you can do quickly

- Instant procedural NACA profile generation
- Switch source between `NACA` and `Library` profiles from local DB
- Live preview while adjusting geometry from the GUI
- Switch between `2D` and `3D` visualization of the same geometry
- Real-time response of quick aerodynamic outputs while editing
- Export to `.pts`, `.dxf`, `.stl`, and `.csv`
- Choose DXF spline or polyline output, plus `XY` or `XYZ` point formats
- Control point density and decimal precision for downstream compatibility
- Use fluid presets for air, water, salt water, or custom properties
- Run `XFOIL Simulation` from GUI to override interpolated/tabular coefficients live
- Choose from thousands of real airfoil profiles, easy to browse and compare, with geometry and aerodynamic data.

## Fastest way to try it (Windows)

1. Download `Manta_Airfoil_Tools_portable_<version>.exe` from the latest release.
2. Run `dist\Manta_Airfoil_Tools_portable_<version>.exe` if you cloned the repository.
3. Alternative from source folder: run `manta_airfoil_tools.bat`.

Unsigned executables may show a SmartScreen prompt on first launch.
